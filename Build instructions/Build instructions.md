**Step 0: Prepare, Purchase, and 3D print**

Before starting the assembly process, purchase additionally to the Ender-3 DIY 3D Printers Kit, the other components for PADL, which are listed in the Bill of Materials, and 3D
print the parts listed in the design file summary. Another option is that the Ender-3 itself
can print the CAD parts before modifying them into a liquid handler if another 3D printer
is not accessible.
The tools necessary for this modification process were, for the most part, provided by
Creality, Shenzen, China. Additionally, is Isopropyl alcohol (IPA), a Q-tip, Super glue,
and tweezers required (see Fig. 1)

**Step 1: Assemble the Ender-3 3D printer**

Start with assembling the Ender-3 3D printer according to the Shenzen Creality 3D Technology guide. Detailed instructions for assembly and use are available on the TF card
provided by the manufacturer.
After assembling the 3D printer, loading the filament, and leveling the wheels and bed
as recommended by the manufacturer, install the software, and prepare to print any of
the G-code files, which the manufacturer loaded onto the TF card. No troubleshooting is
required if the 3D printer functions according to the manufacturer’s specifications. If the
CAD parts are already 3D printed, the modification of the Ender-3 into a PADL can start.
NOTE 1 The power cable the manufacturer provides can have a loose connection, as
shown in Fig. 1a. Replace (Fig. 2b) the power cable with an Australian 3-pin (rating: 10
A at 250 V AC) male connector and an IEC-C13 female connector from a different manufacturer.

NOTE 2 Another possible manufacturer's error is a misaligned Ender-3 frame. The unlevelled frame leads to the inaccuracy of the liquid handler. One solution is to loosen up
one or both M5 screws (circled in yellow), rearrange the base rail until the frame is
aligned, and finally, tighten it again.

**Step 2: Modifications to the Ender-3 motherboard**

Before starting the modification process, turn off the Ender-3 and remove the power cable.
Figure 4 gives an overview of the motherboard of Ender-3. The motherboard provides
connectivity between all the hardware components and moves power to them. The labels
in Fig. 4 on the motherboard refer to the plugs occupied for the 3D printer function.

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/b5be93be-46a2-4d02-afae-3531239dc288)

Step 2.1: Open the electronic box

The motherboard is in the electronic box under the hotbed. To open the electronic box,
remove the three M3 screws (circled in yellow in figure 5) on the cover of the motherboard
by using the hex key. Lift the cover carefully (NOTE 1).
To altogether remove the motherboard cover, follow Step 2.2.

Step 2.1: Open the electronic box

The motherboard is in the electronic box under the hotbed. To open the electronic box,
remove the three M3 screws (circled in yellow in figure 5) on the cover of the motherboard
by using the hex key. Lift the cover carefully (NOTE 1).
To altogether remove the motherboard cover, follow Step 2.2.

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/d2712dc6-a2cb-4290-b3da-b6608579f4f7)

NOTE 1 Be careful while removing the cover of the motherboard. The motherboard fan,
which is attached to the other side of the lid (see figure 17), is plugged into the motherboard, and a forced pull while removing the cover can cause damage to the fan cables.

Step 2.2: Remove the motherboard cover

To remove the motherboard cover altogether, unplug the motherboard fan connector
from the motherboard. The connector is plugged into the controllable motherboard fan
port (see Fig.4). First, remove the hot glue carefully from the connection (NOTE 2). Unplug the motherboard fan connector, carefully remove the motherboard fan, and set it
aside.

NOTE 2 Be gentle while removing the hot glue from the connectors. It is recommended
to use isopropyl alcohol (IPA) on a q-tip. Rub the IPA around the edges of the hot glue
and remove the hot glue with tweezers.

Step 2.3: Remove the redundant cables

In this Step remove all the remaining connectors and cables which are marked with a
red cross in figure 6. The cables connected to the white ports can be removed like the
motherboard fan connector as in Step 2.2. For cables connected to the green ports, first,
unscrew the two screws on top of the port (the screws do not need to be removed). After
a few turns of the screws, the cables can be easily pulled out. Also, the cables which are 
plugged into the ports marked with a replacement sign can be removed in this Step. The
replacement of this cable will be explained in Step 4.5.

**Step 3: Remove the extruder from the X-axis carriage plate** 

For PADL, the extruder is replaced by a syringe pump (Step 7). One can access the
extruder by removing the housing (Step 3.2). Figure 7 shows the extruder fan housing.

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/e312bc77-02c4-4625-b4fe-a293f612c9bc)

Fig 7: Overview of the extruder

NOTE 1 The extruder assembly with the Stepper motor does not need to be removed,
although it has no function for PADL. This makes it easy for the liquid handler to remodify
into a 3D printer.

Step 3.1: Unscrew the Bowden tube

Remove the Bowden tube from the extruder assembly (see Fig. 8a) by unscrewing the
pneumatic connector (circled in yellow) like in Fig. 8b. 

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/2d8158af-2693-40f2-99b7-c8253aef3e3c)

Step 3.2: Unscrew the extruder fan housing

To detach the extruder fan housing (NOTE 2) from the X-axis Carriage Plate, remove
the two M3 screws on the housing. 

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/e27a70b2-eee9-4f67-a1fb-1ab66b0511c0)

NOTE 2 Do not pull on the extruder fan housing because it can cause damage to the
cables. Figure 9b shows that it is impossible to remove the fan housing completely without removing the extruder.

Step 3.3: Remove the extruder

To remove the extruder from the carriage plate, unscrew the two M3 screws on the extruder (see Fig. 10). Set the extruder aside (see Fig. 11).

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/96385d66-eba7-43ef-8e6d-f9547b5e516e)

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/f328a7ab-a8e5-4d9f-bb77-4a044cdc3951)

Step 3.4: Pull out the extruder cables

The last Step to altogether remove the extruder is to remove the cables in the electronic
box, which are already unplugged (Step 2.3). For this Step, approach the Ender-3 from
the rear (see Fig. 12). First, carefully cut the zip tie, which connects the four cable assemblies (multiple cables arranged into a single unit). Secondly, carefully pull the extruder cable assembly. After the cables are pulled out successfully, the extruder can be
set aside. 

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/86357c4c-b08a-4d77-a533-9ea1642ee142)

NOTE 3 Be careful while pulling the extruder cable assembly. The cables can be tangled
in the electronic box, and a forced pull can damage the cables.

**Step 4: Cutting process (Outsource)**

To prepare the modification of the Ender-3 into PADL, three parts must be altered. It is
recommended to outsource these tasks. If the expertise and tools are available, the user
can perform Steps 4.1 to 4.5.

Step 4.1: Cut V-slot rail to size

Cut the V-slot rail to size, as suppliers commonly don’t provide the correct size. Cut the
V-slot rail to 300 mm. The rail is provided with threaded holes at both ends. However,
the threaded holes must be redone on the cut end after cutting the rail at one side. Cut
M5 internal metric threads into the four holes on the cut end to 25 mm (see Fig. 13).

NOTE 1 If the user does the cutting process, wear appropriate personal protective equipment when using cutting tools.

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/0e4ed777-1d5a-486d-8676-c727e7d1a76d)

Step 4.2: Cut the lead screw to size

Cut the M5 lead screw to size, as suppliers commonly don’t provide the correct size. Cut
the lead screw to 270 mm.

NOTE 2 If the user does the cutting process, wear appropriate personal protective equipment when using cutting tools.

Step 4.3: Grind down the two M3 countersunk screw head

This Step is a preparation for Step 9. In Step 9 the Tube Holder will be attached to the
X-axis Carriage Plate. The Tube Holder exits from two parts, which are magnetically
attached. To enable the top part's attachment to the Tube Holder's bottom part (see Fig.
14b), the surface of the bottom part needs to be flat. Figure 14a compares an M3 hex
screw and a ground M3 countersunk screw screwed to the bottom part of the Tube
Holder.
The two M3 countersunk screw heads need to be grind down to a diameter of 4.5 mm
with a tolerance of ± 0.15 mm (NOTE 3). 

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/490c6d33-e96f-4ae4-a78f-f8cd90ac0d48)

NOTE 3 M3 countersunk screws have, according to DIN 7991, a head diameter of a
minimum of 5.54 mm and a maximum of 6.72 mm.

Step 4.4: Cut an opening in the motherboard cover

This Step is a preparation for Step 10. In Step 10, the position of the Z-limit switch will
be adjusted. This alteration leads to the manufacturer's opening for the cable not being
used because otherwise, there is increased tension on the wires of the Z-limit switch and
prevents the motherboard cover from closing. Therefore, an altered wire opening is required to cut.
Unplug the connector and remove the motherboard cover (Step 2.2). Cut the opening at
a distance of 20 mm from the Ender-3 opening, as shown in the figure. The dimensions
of the opening are a length of 14 mm and a width of 6 mm. The dimensions for the altered
opening are shown in figure 15. 

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/e05f5fb2-338f-47da-9274-210c0f9e39a4)

NOTE 4 During the cutting process, ensure the fan on the rear side is not damaged.

NOTE 5 If the cutting process is done by the user, make sure to wear appropriate personal protective equipment when using cutting tools

Step 4.5: Rewire the motherboard fan. **_Note: Step 4.5 is not required for the updated design. The fan can be removed completely from the motherboard and discarded_**

As mentioned in the previous Step (Step 2.3), the extruder fan port in the motherboard
has been replaced; therefore, the motherboard fan needs to be modified to enable the
plugging into the extruder fan port. The modification is illustrated in figure 18.

The reason for plugging the motherboard fan into the extruder fan port is that the motherboard fan function is connected to the part cooling fan, which is redundant for the PADL
version. So, if the part cooling fan is not working, the motherboard fan will not work. Not
cooling the motherboard will eventually damage it. A solution is to plug in the motherboard fan to the extruder fan port as it works without exception and the extruder fan is
redundant for PADL.

Step 4.5.1 Cut the connector of the motherboard fan

To connect the motherboard fan to the extruder fan port, remove the JST-HX-style connector motherboard fan cable (see Fig. 19a). Strip 2.5 cm of the insulation off the end of
each wire.

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/02bb947f-5f72-43cc-87f4-25dfbd249cc4)

NOTE 6 If the user does the cutting process, wear appropriate personal protective equipment when using cutting tools.

Step 4.5.2: Thin the wire ends 

To hold the fine wire ends together after removing the JST-HX-style connector it is recommended to thin the ends using a soldering iron. Figure 19b shows the two thinned
ends of the motherboard fan wires. 

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/d07073f2-23d6-47e2-b174-f0ff911b5562)

NOTE 7 If the user does the thinning process, wear appropriate personal protective
equipment when using soldering tools.

Step 4.5.3: Connect the motherboard fan wires to the extruder fan port

This is the last Step on the main board. Loosen the two screws on the top of the extruder
fan connector and insert the wires (NOTE 8). Tighten the two screws and check that the
wires are still plugged in by gently trying to pull them out.
Figure 19 shows the motherboard with all the cables for the PADL plugged in and the
motherboard fan cable replaced by an extruder fan cable.
The motherboard cover will be closed in Step 10. 

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/0c5755b6-a816-4782-a224-ce19248f45e5)

NOTE 8 It is important to insert the wires (red and black) to correct plugs as illustrated in
figure 18.

**Step 5: Replace the Hotbed leveling springs (keep the springs for Step 7.7) with the
yellow springs**

The yellow replacement springs (see Fig. 20b) are more rigid than the springs supplied
by the manufacturer (see Fig. 20a), which reduces the hotbed's vibration and increases
the positioning accuracy. In addition, the shape of the replacement springs is flat at the
top and bottom, unlike the manufacturer's springs, which are rounded. This results in the
hotbed being flat against these compression springs and less movement or shifting of
the springs during the dispensing process.
The manufacturer's springs are reused for the syringe pump in Step 7.7.

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/dd2a3e8f-3844-4f35-a039-5d3891194826)

Step 5.1: Remove the manufacturer’s springs (Obtaining the springs for the syringe pump clamp mechanism)

To remove the old manufacturer’s springs, loosen the four hotbed adjustment wheels
clockwise (see Fig. 21). Start with the front two wheels simultaneously by turning them
until they can be entirely removed. Repeat this for the two wheels at the back. Set the
four wheels aside.

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/d72d160e-8281-46c9-90f7-171c1dec1bb9)

Step 5.2: Remove the hotbed

Lift the hotbed of the Y-axis carriage plate and set it aside, as shown in Figure 22. Remove the manufacturer’s four springs and obtain one of these springs for the syringe
pump clamp mechanism (NOTE 2). The spring will be needed in Step 7.7.

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/2e5b1357-85a7-4d0f-8961-85b145a823c2)

NOTE 1 Use caution when removing the heater bed, as the heater wiring is located in
the rear left corner.

NOTE 2 Only one of the four springs is needed for the syringe pump clamp mechanism.
The other three can be used as replacements.

Step 5.3: Insert the yellow springs

To insert the yellow springs, set three out of four springs right above the holes of the Yaxis Carriage Plate as shown the Figure 23, and insert the fourth spring onto the screw
in the back-left corner and insert on top of it the hotbed cable strain relief. The following
action is to lift the hotbed with the inserted screws, set it down on top of the springs and
make sure the four screws of the hotbed are inside the springs (see Fig. 24, NOTE 3).
Put the screws down the screw holes of the Y-axis Carriage Plate. 

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/62bef5b0-cd06-4f05-89e9-a6df7321bda9)

NOTE 3 The springs may fall off when placing the hotbed on the Y-axis Carriage Plate.
Make sure that the springs are inserted into the screw.

Step 5.4: Reattach the adjustment wheels

After the hotbed is placed on top of all four springs, reattach the hotbed adjustment
wheels and tighten the wheels anticlockwise. Start with the two wheels at the front, as
shown in Figure 24; however, do not tighten these yet. Put the two wheels at the back
first on. After all four wheels are attached, start tightening the front two wheels down and
repeat this for the back two wheels.

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/0a25c65f-2191-4b29-8d90-e9a9276e5b3c)

Step 5.5: Level the hotbed

After all four wheels are tightened up all the way down, level the hotbed as in Step 1
according to the manufacturer's (Creality) specifications.
Step 6: Remove the POM wheels from the substitute extruder carriage
The POM wheels are utilized in a further Step (Step). Therefore, the wheels are removed
from the extruder carriage plate. The POM wheels are shown in Figure 26b.
Unscrew the three M3 screws (circled in yellow in Figure 26a) and save the three screws,
three POM wheel bearing pulleys, three anti-loosening nuts, two spacers, and the eccentric hexagonal adjuster (shown in Fig.).

NOTE 4 The extruder carriage plate can be used as a substitute.

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/f48cc805-52e2-4474-82c2-95fc4d05a357)

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/86d47e95-c28a-497f-88f2-97381d7563f6)

**Step 7: Assemble the open-source syringe pump** 

The Syringe Pump is based on Baas et al. open-source project. However, some changes
have been made. Compared to Baas et al., this syringe pump enables aspirating in addition to dispensing of liquid. Baas et al. syringe pumps can only dispense liquid with a
maximum dynamic viscosity of 250 mPas. The PADL Syringe Pump can dispense liquids
with a maximum dynamic viscosity of 500 mPas.

Step 7.1: Layout Syringe Pump

Start with laying out all the parts needed to build the open-source syringe pump. All
components used in the syringe pump system are shown in Figure 28. 

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/cbf9bf10-49c3-4d03-ad97-f27d2cd7a07b)

Step 7.2: Install the Syringe End Mount

First, install the Syringe End Mount to the rail which was cut to size in Step 4.1. Slide the
mount onto the rail (see Fig. 29a) and use two M5 x 40 mm screws to fasten it (see Fig.
29b). 

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/93b0e531-11fe-4551-8984-ff9c077a5667)

Step 7.3 Mounting wheels on the Syringe Carriage

First, take the two 3D printed parts, Slide Mount and Slide Carriage Plate. Fit the Slide
Mount onto Slide Carriage Plate as shown in Fig. 30. Now, the parts (M5 bolts, shafts,
eccentric hexagonal adjuster, POM wheels, and nuts) needed, which were removed from
the substitute extruder carriage in Step 6. Insert the three M5 bolts into holes of both
parts in conjunction (see Fig. 31A). Turn around the Slide Mount and Slide Carriage Plate
facing with the rear and insert the other parts in the following order: spacer or eccentric
hexagonal adjuster (as in Fig. 31A, NOTE 1), POM wheels (see Fig. 31B) and nuts (see
Fig. 31C). Tighten the bolds by holding the nuts with a wrench and screw the bolt onto
the nut with a hex key. 

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/db302d01-68b7-4979-a727-e98cde55e84a)

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/63e64dad-030e-4bd2-b014-f831ebff443d)

Fig. 31: Mounting the Syringe Carriage with spacer/eccentric hexagonal adjuster (A),
POM wheels (B), and nuts (C).

NOTE 1 The eccentric nut needs to be inserted on the bolt as shown in Figure 31C,
otherwise, the rail guidance mechanism will fail.

NOTE 2 The eccentric hexagonal adjuster will be later used to remove slop in the rail
guidance mechanism. 

Step 7.4: Insert the Syringe Carriage on to the rail

Slide the Syringe Carriage onto the rail. Figure 32a shows that the carriage may indicate
a slop in the rail guidance mechanism, which can cause the carriage not to move or not
to slide effortlessly onto the rail. One solution is to adjust the tension of the wheels by
turning the eccentric hexagonal adjuster (see figure 32b). Figure 32c shows a mounted
syringe carriage on the rail.

NOTE 3 An indication of misalignment is the wheels not being parallel, as shown in figure
32a.

Step 7.5: Install the Stepper End Mount

Install the Stepper Motor End Mount using M5 x 40 mm screws. Slide the mount onto
the rail (see Fig. 33a) and fasten the screws (see Fig. 32b). 

![image](https://github.com/nkonstantini/Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project/assets/145983034/eacd9b3d-14a9-4170-9b23-7f50ae5eada1)

NOTE 4 The Syringe Carriage must already be sided onto the rail (Step 7.4) before installing the Stepper End Mount.

Step 7.6: Install the Stepper motor on the Stepper Motor End Mount

Four M3 x 16 mm screws are required to install the Stepper motor. Place the Stepper
motor onto the Stepper Motor End Mount, as shown in Fig. 34 (NOTE 5). Position the
four screws in the holes, as shown in Figure 35a, and fasten the screws onto the Stepper
motor (see Fig. 35b).

Fig. 34: Stepper motor placed onto the Stepper Motor End Mount

NOTE 5 The Stepper motor connector should face the correct direction, as represented
in Figure 34 by an arrow.

Step 7.7: Install the Syringe clamping Mechanism

The Syringe Clamping Mechanism is designed to prevent the syringe from moving. This
mechanism consists of a Clamp Bar, a spring (collected in Step 5.1), and a Dovetail Cap
(see Fig. 36). Clamp Bars are available. They can be changed to accommodate different
syringe diameters. Slide the Clamp Bar into the slot on top of the Syringe End Mount,
followed by the spring (see Fig. 37a). Secure the Syringe Clamping Mechanism by closing the slot with the Dovetail Cap (see Fig. 37b)

Step 7.8: Assemble leadscrew-and-nut system

The leadscrew-and-nut system enables the syringe plunger to be pushed or pulled so
that the liquid can be dispensed or aspirated. The rotational movement of the leadscrew
is translated into a linear movement via the leadscrew-and-nut system.

Step 7.8.1: Insert leadscrew through the Syringe End Mount
Slide the leadscrew (cut to size in Step 4) through the Syringe End Mount, up to the
Syringe Carriage (see Fig. 38).
