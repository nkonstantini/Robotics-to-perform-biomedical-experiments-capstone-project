# Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project (PADL v2)
This repository contains all the design files, firmware modifications, and code used for this capstone project in order for you to replicate our work and design your own PADL v2 system.

## Folders:

Build instructions
-  This includes the Bill of Materials used in this project, as well as any tools required.
- This contains the full instructions in order to build this design yourself.

STL files
- This contains all the ready-to-print Fusion360 files we have used in the design.
- Some parts have been sourced from Sukukumar (2023) and [stratop80 (2015)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1071695/files)

CAD files
- This contains all the CAD files we used (.f3d), in case you wish to modify the design. Note that we do not have all the STL files available as CAD files.


Laser cut files
- This contains the file for all the laser-cut parts in 3 different file types (.pdf, .dxf and .cdr)

Marlin firmware
- This contains the necessary instructions to reflash and modify the Marlin firmware on your Ender-3. There is an option to just download the firmware configuration we used if you do not wish to do this yourself.

Python files
- This contains Python files that can generate and export G-code for beginners.
- This contains Python files that can capture the webcam output.
