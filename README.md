# Robotics-to-perform-biomedical-experiments-capstone-project
This repository contains all the design files, firmware modifications, and code used for this capstone project in order for you to replicate our work

## Folders:
STL files
- This contains all the ready-to-print Fusion360 files we have used in the design

CAD files
- This contains all the CAD files we used, in case you wish to modify the design. Note that we do not have all the STL files available as CAD files.

Marlin firmware
- This contains the necessary instructions to reflash and modify the Marlin firmware on your Ender-3. There is an option to just download the firmware configuration we used if you do not wish to do this yourself.
